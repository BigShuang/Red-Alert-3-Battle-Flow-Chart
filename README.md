## FAQ
- **How to export the chart after drawing?**

I haven't implemented the image export function, but you can use the screenshot API provided by chrome to take screenshots as follows:
In chrome, Ctrl + Shift + I open devtools.
In devtools, Ctrl + Shift + P opens the command menu.
Enter `screenshot` in the command menu.
Click `capture full size screenshot` to complete the screenshot.
